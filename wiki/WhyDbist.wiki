= An Easy Database Management Framework for Java =

The Dbist is an easy Java programming framework to manage dababase.<br>
It's truly an easiest way to do database programming.<br>
You may already know about many other ORM Frameworks (Hibernate, mybatis, Active Record ...).<br>
But it's easier.

Now, you can see why we must use Dbist instead of them.

== Examples ==

=== Select a data from database ===

Select by primary key value
{{{
Post post = Dbist.getDml().select(Post.class, "1");
}}}
Select by composite key value array
{{{
Post post = Dbist.getDml().select(Post.class, toArray("public", "1"));
}}}
Select by composite key value List
{{{
List<Object> id = new ArrayList<Object>();
id.add("public");
id.add("1");
Post post = Dbist.getDml().select(Post.class, id);
}}}
Select by composite key value HttpServletRequest
{{{
Post post = Dbist.getDml().select(Post.class, request);
}}}
