Welcome to be a Dbist! This framework is easy to use. It'll takes only a few minutes before you start DB programming, if you're already prepared to program a java application.<br><br>
Dbist currently supports Oracle only, but it'll be extended to other DB types soon. (SQLServer, DB2, ...)<br>
If you're an oracle user, you can start right now.<br>
