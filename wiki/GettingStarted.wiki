== Introduction ==

Welcome to be a Dbist! This framework is easy to use. It'll takes only a few minutes before you start DB programming, if you're already prepared to program a java application.<br><br>
Dbist currently supports Oracle only, but it'll be extended to other DB types soon. (SQLServer, DB2, ...)<br>
If you're an oracle user, you can start right now.<br>
Let's begin...

== Installation ==

  # Java SE JDK 6
  # Tomcat 7 (or another WAS which supports Servlet 3.0)
  # Maven2 or later
  # Eclipse Indigo or later (IDE for Java EE Developers)
  # Eclipse Plugin - Maven Integration for Eclipse (by Eclipse Marketplace)
  # Oracle 10g or later

== Running Example Sources ==

  # Create an oracle Database (ex. dbist)
  # Run this script to the Database 
  # Download this dbist-example.war file (or check-out the example project from Dbist SVN)
